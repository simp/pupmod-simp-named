* Thu Oct 13 2016 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 5.0.0-0
- Updated to use the deconflicted 'simpcat'

* Tue Oct 11 2016 Lucas Yamanishi <lucas.yamanishi@onyxpoint.com> - 4.3.3-0
- This patch corrects the following shortcomings to ensure compatability
  with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and its clones:
    - Ensures all required directories exist in the chroot
    - Remove dependencies for the non-existent `named-chroot-setup.service`
    - Use new-style daemon invocation, executing in the foreground and
      logging to stderr.  See daemon(7).
    - Since new-style daemons don't require a PID file, nor does the binary
      generate one in foreground mode, remove it from the service file.

* Wed Jul 06 2016 Nick Miller <nick.miller@onyxpoint.com> - 4.3.1-0
- Changed the Exec['restart-systemd'] to Exec['systemctl-daemon-reload']
  to avoid a conflict with puppetlabs-postgresql

  default), but 'default' can be changed in case you want a DNS server
  with a whole different configuration.
