- Changed puppet-server requirement to puppet

* Mon Sep 15 2014 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.2.0-5
- Restricted the rsync of materials in /etc in non-chroot so that
  users can't accidentally destroy the permissions on /etc itself.

- Updated to provide the appropriate pointers to the new rsync layout.

- Updated caching nameserver to be SELinux compatible.

* Thu Jun 26 2014 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 4.2.0-2

- Made several adjustments to make the rsync space more clear.
- The chroot and non_chroot spaces now reference rsync/default (by
  default), but 'default' can be changed in case you want a DNS server
  with a whole different configuration.

* Mon Mar 03 2014 Kendall Moore <kmoore@keywcorp.com> - 4.1.0-1

  SELinux is enabled since these two states are incompatible (and unnecessary).
